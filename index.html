								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The day began sunny side up, until pent-up frustration creeped in and the world turned upside down. Kick-started the day with a run, and realised that I can now tell the time by
looking at the sunlight on the leaves of the tree outside my window. Thank God the weather is
decent, because I couldn't handle this during winter. Some days it feels like we only just
started social distancing and WFH last week... and then you realize it's been two months! It's
startling to see how much structure the old 9-5 provided. Now I am responsible for setting up
my own rhythm (riddim). My back hurt. And the limitations of working off a 15” laptop screen
became very apparent today.</p>
<p>New day, and it's so rainy and gloomy today. What a relief after two weeks of sunshine
that you can't properly enjoy. I watched the thunder roll in. I really don't like the rain and the
cold, but it does make you appreciate the sunshine more. After the greyest day, I'm looking
forward to the bow after the rain! I'm healthy and I made someone smile today, it was a good
day. Especially for a Monday – no tube delays, no sweaty carriage, no wifi issues and I even
got a thank you from my client. AND it's still light at 6pm. It's a cosy day – I love the sound of
the rain, which is also making me appreciate the time at home more. It's incredible to realize
just how much time is wasted on commuting – two hours back every day. But I'm bored, I'm
lonely, I'm all out of sorts. I don't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. At least
weekly calls with family and friends keep lifting my spirits. Ironically, Covid-19 has done two
things – social distancing and building bonds at the same time. Isolation forces the extra effort
to stay in touch. Yesterday I had a lovely facetime with my family and my heart is full. But it
made me miss them so much more. I thought about my mother (83 years old) today... and how
even just a few months of isolation and social distancing are so much more of a loss of her
precious time. Finally, the sun came out, and I actually notice it so much more now.
A sunny day with a side of panic. I woke up this morning thinking it was Sunday,
realized it was Wednesday, decided it would be nice to shower and get dressed for a change,
only to have both my son and wife look at me with that "what are you thinking?" face.
Straightened my hair for the first time in six weeks and felt pretty. I ate, I ran, I ate some more.
You know what all this has made me realise? I love coffee and almond croissants. I got a look
from my postman that said "you are really milking that Amazon Prime subscription". It may
have been my third delivery of the week ... on a Wednesday. And yet, I never thought I'd find
myself trawling through Amazon looking for beans, and not the baked kind you find in a tin. The
school thought it'd be fun to have an experiment. I could barely track down flour let alone
beans that aren't in a tin. I waited thirty days for an Amazon toilet paper delivery—it was a
scam. So instead, I had the girls draw a beanstalk and sent that to their teachers, boom! Using
one's initiative to be innovative. Homeschooling is hard, but here's an upside: I taught
meteorology before work and we made origami replicas of native butterflies at night. The
downside? My child is a banshee this morning... she's testing every inch of my sanity!! My
youngest wet the bed at 4am. Changing her sheets was the most exercise I have done in five
days. But it can also be surprisingly calm for a copywriter/daddy daycare operator for a
1-year-old, while the wife heads to work at a hospital during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Another day sheltering in place, another messy bun on top of my head. It's cloudy
again; I don't think I'd mind the gloom if it wasn't for all the doom. On the upside, I stopped my
cat from eating my snake in the middle of a client presentation. Some days look like this: log
on, check mails, feed baby, walk baby, put baby down for nap, take work calls, feed baby,
walk baby, take calls, play with baby, respond to emails, feed baby, bathe baby, respond to
emails, put baby down to bed, log on start part two of the work day. And others are made by
my recently potty trained 2-year-old interrupting my international leadership meeting by
walking into a room with his pants around his ankles screaming 'Mommy, I pooped!'. I love all
this extra family time. During the work day I'm treated to a chorus of new-born birds cheeping
from their nest in the roof gutter. And a Woodpecker family getting violently kicked out of their
tree hole by a rival bird family while giving a client presentation about home loans. How fitting.
COVID-19 made me realise that the most important parts of a building are the windows. I find
myself feeling like Doctor Dolittle, and talking to animals. I'm great mates with "Limpy" (a
squirrel, with a bad leg!). He prefers the tougher name of "Hard knocks" but he'll always be
Limpy to me. Animal crossing is life. All in all, today was great, but don't eat bats people, it
fucks up the world. I ate some more. I was thinking about that tub of ice cream in the fridge all
day; finally gave in at around 4 and it was the highlight of my day!</p>
<p>New same, same day… it's getting boring now. My husband speaks loud enough on his
conference calls to be heard without the computer; dogs huff to go out; dogs bark at those
who dare to pass by; dogs huff to go out; work gets done; leave the dining room and shut the
light. And even in the midst of all the monotony, I was able to rediscover the joy and
satisfaction of riding my bicycle. Now that it is so much less daunting in the uncongested
suburbia, I rescued the bike from its two-year stint in the shed for exercise and errands. I also
became fixated on filling my flat with plants and I'm not sure why - maybe it's because they
give me some kind of purpose, some kind of visible, tangible change, something to do. Can't
help but feel anger and disappointment, not much else today. It hit me that quarantine will be
the new bar to compare if we really like someone. So it was a little scary today to let three
outsiders into our home to replace our air conditioning system. It was the first time I've spoken
to an outsider in person in over seven weeks. I haven't seen some of those closest to me in five
to six weeks now, but work being so busy has been a nice distraction from that. I felt happy as
I was enjoying my new walking routine before work in the morning, hearing the birds, smelling
the flowers on trees, feeling accomplished for exercising. Yet, as I thought about all the things
I'm going to miss out on this summer, like swimming in pools, going to fairs, seeing friends and
family at barbecues, my eyes filled up with tears with a sense of mourning and loss. I'm
regretting all the times prior to lockdown I said no to a cheeky post-work pint and chose to
head home instead..I've learnt my lesson! Finally, the clock chimes 5pm and it's a crude
reminder that another day flew by without me uttering a single word out loud. Today sadness
wins, I'll try again tomorrow.</p>
<p>“dancing on the deck of the Titanic” replayed in my mind, and my heart felt both heavy and
light, like those glass frames filled with sand and colored fluid that you turn over and over to
watch new landscapes form; and meanwhile the baby hummingbirds we’ve watched from the
time their microscopic hearts fluttered inside two white jellybeans are twitching in their
too-small nest, their tiny, pure-black eyes wide open, taking in the immensity of the sky, their
imminent domain of danger, nourishment and exquisite freedom. It was the busiest day in a
long time. But then we saw it when it moved out of the nest onto the branch, saw it as it took
flight, perhaps for the first time leaving its sibling; and we set up our computers around the
datura tree, on the porch and in the garden below, so we could work and watch what might
come next: for it to return, for the sibling to follow suit, for the mother to come and see what
had happened seemingly overnight. Felt drained by the end of day. Wanted to work out, but
only managed to plank for a bit. Cooked, ate dinner, watched Outbreak and now I'm feeling
cautious. Probably not the best idea right now. I don't really understand how I can be so tired
all the time when I'm barely moving. My chair is killing my back and the cat on my lap is like a
personal space heater I don't need and didn't ask for. But I'm grateful to be healthy, employed,
and supported by my team. I'm discovering the power of breath-work, what a joy! Lots of fun
conversations with colleagues and challenging work on my first day back from staycation, but
I'm smiling all day thanks to fabulous creative thinking by the team. I ate some more. The
three-week old grapes in the fridge were crisp and mold-free, so I said screw it and ate them.
The power of Spotify's 'Feel Good' playlist set the tone for my day. As I headed out for my
daily morning walk, I saw my favourite coffee shop reopen for takeaways after seven weeks,
and bumped into my old tennis coach heading to spruce up our local courts. Today was a
good day!</p>
<p>followed by a bloody chicken tail today. A most surreal and sad day, a day my family needed to
be hugged, but couldn't be. Then a new neighbour dropped a card, flowers and a colouring
book into our house. Meanwhile some crazy, delusional people are taking the government to
court over social distancing measures. At times I am hit with a wave of melancholia, but it is
not strong enough to knock me off my feet. Receiving a lovely handwritten letter in the post
today was the nicest surprise. I realised that I'm not shy about knitting while in meetings – I
finished a sweater I had been working on during my commute for three months, without
missing a beat in any of them. On days like this, I'm grateful for the one line, one story outlet as
I no longer have my pod-mates to regale with all my innermost and randomest of thoughts.
Enjoyable day actually. It flew by because I was genuinely flat-out. Most importantly, we've
finally answered a question no one ever asked - can zombies bake bread?
42nd consecutive day working out with gym buddies over zoom early this morning. But
today felt like this: sgdniuoaghuowrahguowhvetuigwuaityuwetuithuiwaesrhtuiaszhtui – a lot like
yesterday and I suspect tomorrow will be the same… The week feels slow and I thought today
was Friday! I don't look good on Zoom. They need filters that make me look like I have had
more sleep. I haven't left the house all week and it's Thursday, which would normally freak me
out but somehow it doesn't seem abnormal anymore... That's weird. This time last year I was
sunning it up in Barbados, but today it's raining and I'm at home. On more of a positive note I
finally finished my second book, and learnt to do my own lash extensions. I'm not sure if I
would've survived the lockdown without Pringles.The world will have to send Nintendo a big
thank you for Animal Crossing too, if we ever get back to normal. Locked down we may be, but
life in all its guises continues apace: family birthday, funeral for a friend's dad, Hangout
meetings, all in the same day. Got caught in the rain today, so I just stood there allowing the
raindrops to fall on my face. For a while it felt like the old times, when the world was alright.
But, the new normal is strange and trying to adjust is tough. I just really want things to go back
to normal. But going to 7/11 with a mask on and then disinfecting all my purchases is where
we are at. Clean house, clean dog, so treated myself to a fresh pair of stolen hotel slippers
from my ever-dwindling supply. Today happiness wins. My husband and I bought our first
home together. And as I watched a little girl on the back of a Sea-Doo hold onto her father for
dear life, I realized it was the perfect metaphor for life.</p>
